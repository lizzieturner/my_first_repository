The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of Git -- from creating repositories to pushing code to creating branches, Git is a backbone of programming and it's extremely important to be comfortable using it, *especially* from the command line (as opposed to using GitHub's web UI). Of course, the web UI does have it's place; for example, it's often convenient to make minor edits in the web UI.
